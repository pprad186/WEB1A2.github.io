Assignment 2

• Firstly, with the feedback from Assignment 1, I put all html files except index in their own folder called html.
• I combined all the css files into one "styles.css" file and then using that css file as the base started manipulating the layout for each device view in separate css files. Also, took the reset.css file from the start.zip folder provided on D2l and the normalize.css file from the internet (github.com/necolas/normalize.css)  
• I changed most of the tables into divs/sections to better apply flex and grid to make the flow of the website better.
• I strengthened the site's semantic foundation by adding landmarks and clarifying structure. This included adding a proper <main> region, giving <nav> elements descriptive ARIA labels (learned from WCAG), and ensuring each page had an understandable reading order. These changes help screen readers navigate the page more efficiently and give users with disabilities a clearer, more predictable layout.
• I improved accessibility by providing descriptive, context-aware alt text for meaningful images and ensuring all images pointed to valid files. Instead of labeling images generically (e.g., "beige-boots"), the new alt text explains the content and purpose of each image, making visual information accessible to non-visual users.
• I increased color contrast in areas where text was too faint and added strong focus outlines for links, buttons, and form fields. These changes improve clarity, readability, and keyboard accessibility, helping users who rely on non-mouse input methods.
• I implemented a consistent container structure for large screens and ensured layout rules didn't override or hide content. These changes support device adaptability and maintain accessibility across screen sizes and zoom levels.
